Hello!

I hope you're still the way you have been before. The last months have been full of changes, and most were'nt good, though there are few things that have not been sorted out in some way. This first post is just to give you an idea of what has happened; It's a Preface, and the real story will be continued in the next posts that are to come, less often, but still somehow regularly\dots{}
I'm glad to see you're still with me, and I want to thank OliFre for his further work on this system that makes the presentation of my texts really unique. I hope you feel the same way. 
Still, no opinions in any way have arrived, but he who wants to be understood has to be patient. Now, I can't do a thing but continue, and if not for anybody out there, then at least for me myself.
